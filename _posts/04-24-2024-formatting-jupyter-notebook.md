# Formatting Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks provide a powerful platform for data analysis and visualization, thanks to their support for Markdown, code, and multimedia content. Here's a guide to some of the key formatting capabilities you can use in your notebooks.

## Headers

Use headers to structure your document. You can use multiple levels of headers to organize content.

```markdown
# This is a level 1 header
## This is a level 2 header
### This is a level 3 header
#### This is a level 4 header
##### This is a level 5 header
###### This is a level 6 header
```

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text using bold, italics, or strikethrough.

```markdown
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

~~This text will be crossed out~~
```

## Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists can help organize information.

```markdown
### Unordered list
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

### Ordered list
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

## Links and Images

Embedding links and images can enhance the explanatory power of your notebook.

```markdown
![Image](https://www.example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Code Blocks and Syntax Highlighting

You can include code blocks with or without syntax highlighting.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

```
No highlight block
```

## Tables

Tables are useful for presenting structured data.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 3    | Data     | Data     |

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be used to quote someone or highlight text.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Horizontal Rules

A horizontal rule is a good way to separate sections.

```markdown
---
```

## LaTeX Equations

You can include mathematical expressions both inline and as blocks.

```markdown
Inline: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

Block:
$$
egin{align*}

abla \cdot ec{\mathbf{E}} & = rac {
ho} {\epsilon_0} \

abla \cdot ec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0 \

abla 	imes ec{\mathbf{E}} & = -rac{\partial ec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} \

abla 	imes ec{\mathbf{B}} & = \mu_0ec{\mathbf{J}} + \mu_0\epsilon_0rac{\partial ec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t}
\end{align*}
$$
```

This is just a start, but these formatting tools can greatly enhance the clarity and visual appeal of your Jupyter Notebook. Happy documenting!
